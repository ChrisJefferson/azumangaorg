</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My most recent trip into exercise began about 18 months ago, when I read a BBC news article which said people should walk 10,000 steps a day (that's about 5km, or 3 miles). That seemed like as good an idea as any! I got a <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/zip">fitbit zip</a> from my lovely wife, and set off!</p>
<p>At first achieving 10,000 steps was hard work -- if I managed it one day, I would need a rest the next! Eventually I got to the point where it is comfortable, and settled into a routine.</p>
<p>You can see my success at <a href="http://fitbit.ly/azumanga">fitbit.ly</a>, and alternative (and great) website for quickly viewing fitbit stats. I've passed 7,000,000 steps, and hitting my target on 389 days.</p>
<p>So, what's my opinion on Fitbit? For beginners, they are great. Don't underestimate the Fitbit Zip, while it is the oldest and simplest product Fitbit make, it has some big advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs for 6 months off one tiny battery</li>
<li>Can be stored easily. Fitbit suggest clipping it to your belt, I kept it on my keyring.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zip isn't perfect, at first I found my keys were too heavy, and the jingling was making the Fitbit count around double steps. Dumping a bunch of keys I never used got the weight to a more sensible level.</p>
<p>So, what are the limitations of the Fitbit? The plateau. Walking 10,000 steps takes me about an hour and forty minutes, achieving more steps on a daily basis takes too long. Fitbit doesn't encourage hard exercise -- while you can do your steps faster by going faster, I found it very hard work to go a little faster, it wasn't really helping get the steps much faster, and took away my enjoyment of my evening walk, listening to audio book or podcasts!</p>
<p>So, while Fitbit was a good start, the time has come to push beyond! Onwards and Upwards!</p><p><a href="http://www.azumanga.org/exercise-past.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></p>                </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>While reading the local paper I saw <a href="http://www.timefitness.co.uk/">Time Fitness</a>, a local gym, was running a competition for four people to win a six month gym membership, a weekly meeting with a personal trainer, and all kinds of other help and support.</p>
<p>Long story short (for today), I applied and won! I've very excited, but don't really want to pollute everyone's Facebook with it every day, so I will put my thoughts, and (hopefully) my progress here.</p><p><a href="http://www.azumanga.org/gym-introduction.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></p>                </article>
