That seemed like as good an idea as any! I got a &lt;a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/zip"&gt;fitbit zip&lt;/a&gt; from my lovely wife, and set off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first achieving 10,000 steps was hard work -- if I managed it one day, I would need a rest the next! Eventually I got to the point where it is comfortable, and settled into a routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see my success at &lt;a href="http://fitbit.ly/azumanga"&gt;fitbit.ly&lt;/a&gt;, and alternative (and great) website for quickly viewing fitbit stats. I've passed 7,000,000 steps, and hitting my target on 389 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's my opinion on Fitbit? For beginners, they are great. Don't underestimate the Fitbit Zip, while it is the oldest and simplest product Fitbit make, it has some big advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs for 6 months off one tiny battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be stored easily. Fitbit suggest clipping it to your belt, I kept it on my keyring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zip isn't perfect, at first I found my keys were too heavy, and the jingling was making the Fitbit count around double steps. Dumping a bunch of keys I never used got the weight to a more sensible level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the limitations of the Fitbit? The plateau. Walking 10,000 steps takes me about an hour and forty minutes, achieving more steps on a daily basis takes too long. Fitbit doesn't encourage hard exercise -- while you can do your steps faster by going faster, I found it very hard work to go a little faster, it wasn't really helping get the steps much faster, and took away my enjoyment of my evening walk, listening to audio book or podcasts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while Fitbit was a good start, the time has come to push beyond! Onwards and Upwards!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Gym Introduction</title><link href="http://fitness.azumanga.org/gym-introduction.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jefferson</name></author><id>tag:fitness.azumanga.org,2015-01-05:gym-introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While reading the local paper I saw &lt;a href="http://www.timefitness.co.uk/"&gt;Time Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, a local gym, was running a competition for four people to win a six month gym membership, a weekly meeting with a personal trainer, and all kinds of other help and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short (for today), I applied and won! I've very excited, but don't really want to pollute everyone's Facebook with it every day, so I will put my thoughts, and (hopefully) my progress here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
