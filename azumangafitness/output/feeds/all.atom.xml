I read a BBC news article which said people should walk 10,000 steps a day (that's around 5km, or 3 miles). While 10,000 steps appeared an arbitrary target, it seemed as good a target as any! To keep track of my steps I received a &lt;a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/zip"&gt;Fitbit Zip&lt;/a&gt; from my lovely wife and set off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first achieving 10,000 steps was hard work -- when I managed it one day, I would be too stiff to achieve it the next. Karen was very good during this phase, putting up with my aches and pains. After a couple of months I reached the point where 10,000 steps were comfortable and settled into a routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see my Fitbit results at &lt;a href="http://fitbit.ly/azumanga"&gt;fitbit.ly&lt;/a&gt;, an alternative (and great) website for quickly viewing Fitbit stats. I've passed 7,000,000 steps and have hit my target of 10,000 steps for 389 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's my opinion on Fitbit? For beginners, they are great. Don't underestimate the Fitbit Zip, while it's the oldest and simplest product Fitbit make, it has two big advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs for 6 months off one tiny battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be stored easily. Fitbit suggest clipping it to your belt, I kept it on my keyring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zip isn't perfect, at first I found my keys were too heavy, and the jingling was making the Fitbit count around double steps. Dumping a bunch of keys I never used got the weight to a more sensible level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the limitations of Fitbit? The plateau. Walking 10,000 steps takes me an hour and forty minutes, achieving more steps on a daily basis takes too long. Fitbit doesn't encourage hard exercise. While you can cover 10,000 steps sooner by going faster, only a little faster is much harder. Working harder reduced my enjoyment of walking, listening to audio books and podcasts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while 10,000 steps was a beginning, the time has come to push onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Gym Introduction</title><link href="http://fitness.azumanga.org/gym-introduction.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-30T17:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jefferson</name></author><id>tag:fitness.azumanga.org,2015-04-30:gym-introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading the local paper I saw &lt;a href="http://www.timefitness.co.uk/"&gt;Time Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, a local gym, was running a competition. This competition would award four people to win a six month gym membership, a weekly meeting with a personal trainer, and other help and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short (for today), I applied and won! I've been very excited, but don't really want to pollute everyone's Facebook with gym-related posts every every day. Instead, I will put my thoughts, and (hopefully) my progress here in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
