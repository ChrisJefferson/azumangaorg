</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My most recent trip into exercise began 18 months ago. I read a BBC news article which said people should walk 10,000 steps a day (that's around 5km, or 3 miles). While 10,000 steps appeared an arbitrary target, it seemed as good a target as any! To keep track of my steps I received a <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/zip">Fitbit Zip</a> from my lovely wife and set off.</p>
<p>At first achieving 10,000 steps was hard work -- when I managed it one day, I would be too stiff to achieve it the next. Karen was very good during this phase, putting up with my aches and pains. After a couple of months I reached the point where 10,000 steps were comfortable and settled into a routine.</p>
<p>You can see my Fitbit results at <a href="http://fitbit.ly/azumanga">fitbit.ly</a>, an alternative (and great) website for quickly viewing Fitbit stats. I've passed 7,000,000 steps and have hit my target of 10,000 steps for 389 days.</p>
<p>So, what's my opinion on Fitbit? For beginners, they are great. Don't underestimate the Fitbit Zip, while it's the oldest and simplest product Fitbit make, it has two big advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs for 6 months off one tiny battery</li>
<li>Can be stored easily. Fitbit suggest clipping it to your belt, I kept it on my keyring.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zip isn't perfect, at first I found my keys were too heavy, and the jingling was making the Fitbit count around double steps. Dumping a bunch of keys I never used got the weight to a more sensible level.</p>
<p>What are the limitations of Fitbit? The plateau. Walking 10,000 steps takes me an hour and forty minutes, achieving more steps on a daily basis takes too long. Fitbit doesn't encourage hard exercise. While you can cover 10,000 steps sooner by going faster, only a little faster is much harder. Working harder reduced my enjoyment of walking, listening to audio books and podcasts!</p>
<p>So, while 10,000 steps was a beginning, the time has come to push onwards and upwards!</p><p><a href="http://fitness.azumanga.org/exercise-past.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></p>                </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I was reading the local paper I saw <a href="http://www.timefitness.co.uk/">Time Fitness</a>, a local gym, was running a competition. This competition would award four people to win a six month gym membership, a weekly meeting with a personal trainer, and other help and support.</p>
<p>Long story short (for today), I applied and won! I've been very excited, but don't really want to pollute everyone's Facebook with gym-related posts every every day. Instead, I will put my thoughts, and (hopefully) my progress here in this blog.</p><p><a href="http://fitness.azumanga.org/gym-introduction.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></p>                </article>
