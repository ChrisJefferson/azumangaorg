I was reading the local paper I saw [Time Fitness](http://www.timefitness.co.uk/), a local gym, was running a competition. This competition would award four people to win a six month gym membership, a weekly meeting with a personal trainer, and other help and support.

Long story short (for today), I applied and won! I've been very excited, but don't really want to pollute everyone's Facebook with gym-related posts every every day. Instead, I will put my thoughts, and (hopefully) my progress here in this blog.
