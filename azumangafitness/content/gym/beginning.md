While reading the local paper I saw [Time Fitness](http://www.timefitness.co.uk/), a local gym, was running a competition for four people to win a six month gym membership, a weekly meeting with a personal trainer, and all kinds of other help and support.

Long story short (for today), I applied and won! I've very excited, but don't really want to pollute everyone's Facebook with it every day, so I will put my thoughts, and (hopefully) my progress here.
