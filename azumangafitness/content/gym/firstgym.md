Yesterday I made my first trip to the gym for exercising! My first meeting with Euan Miller (the personal trainer at Time Fitness) is on Wednesday, so I decided to stick to cycling.

Result: 30 minutes of hard cycling, this morning a stiff hip joint. Decided to relax today.

Excellent (and healthy) food provided by Karen, for both lunch and dinner.
