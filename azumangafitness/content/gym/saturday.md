Most surprising thing on Thursday morning was that, after working very hard, I felt fine!

I was a little stiff, and had tiredness in my muscles, certainly. On the other hand, I did not have the serious joint pains that have accompanied days of serious exercise in the past -- the benefit of a professional is that they know how to push you hard, without breaking anything!

I have repeated(ish) the same routine on Friday evening and Saturday morning. I didn't push myself quite as hard, but I'm pleased with the hour of exercise I put in on both days.
