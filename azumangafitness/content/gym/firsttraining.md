Today I had my first session with Euan Miller, the personal trainer at Time Fitness.

* How long into the hour I would have slowed down by myself: 8 Minutes
* Number of times I would have stopped for a rest: At least 20
* Number of times I thought I was going to have to stop even with a trainer: 3

Overall a really successful day, wonder how I will feel tomorrow!
