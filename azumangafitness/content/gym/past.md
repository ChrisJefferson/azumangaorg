My most recent trip into exercise began 18 months ago. I read a BBC news article which said people should walk 10,000 steps a day (that's around 5km, or 3 miles). While 10,000 steps appeared an arbitrary target, it seemed as good a target as any! To keep track of my steps I received a [Fitbit Zip](https://www.fitbit.com/uk/zip) from my lovely wife and set off.

At first achieving 10,000 steps was hard work -- when I managed it one day, I would be too stiff to achieve it the next. Karen was very good during this phase, putting up with my aches and pains. After a couple of months I reached the point where 10,000 steps were comfortable and settled into a routine.

You can see my Fitbit results at [fitbit.ly](http://fitbit.ly/azumanga), an alternative (and great) website for quickly viewing Fitbit stats. I've passed 7,000,000 steps and have hit my target of 10,000 steps for 389 days.

So, what's my opinion on Fitbit? For beginners, they are great. Don't underestimate the Fitbit Zip, while it's the oldest and simplest product Fitbit make, it has two big advantages:

* Runs for 6 months off one tiny battery
* Can be stored easily. Fitbit suggest clipping it to your belt, I kept it on my keyring.

The Zip isn't perfect, at first I found my keys were too heavy, and the jingling was making the Fitbit count around double steps. Dumping a bunch of keys I never used got the weight to a more sensible level.

What are the limitations of Fitbit? The plateau. Walking 10,000 steps takes me an hour and forty minutes, achieving more steps on a daily basis takes too long. Fitbit doesn't encourage hard exercise. While you can cover 10,000 steps sooner by going faster, only a little faster is much harder. Working harder reduced my enjoyment of walking, listening to audio books and podcasts!

So, while 10,000 steps was a beginning, the time has come to push onwards and upwards!
