Title: Exercise Past

Summary: Exercise Past

My most recent trip into exercise began about 18 months ago, when I read a BBC news article which said people should walk 10,000 steps a day (that's about 5km, or 3 miles). That seemed like as good an idea as any! I got a [fitbit zip](https://www.fitbit.com/uk/zip) from my lovely wife, and set off!

At first achieving 10,000 steps was hard work -- if I managed it one day, I would need a rest the next! Eventually I got to the point where it is comfortable, and settled into a routine.

You can see my success at [fitbit.ly](http://fitbit.ly/azumanga), and alternative (and great) website for quickly viewing fitbit stats. I've passed 7,000,000 steps, and hitting my target on 389 days.

So, what's my opinion on Fitbit? For beginners, they are great. Don't underestimate the Fitbit Zip, while it is the oldest and simplest product Fitbit make, it has some big advantages:

* Runs for 6 months off one tiny battery
* Can be stored easily. Fitbit suggest clipping it to your belt, I kept it on my keyring.

The Zip isn't perfect, at first I found my keys were too heavy, and the jingling was making the Fitbit count around double steps. Dumping a bunch of keys I never used got the weight to a more sensible level.

So, what are the limitations of the Fitbit? The plateau. Walking 10,000 steps takes me about an hour and forty minutes, achieving more steps on a daily basis takes too long. Fitbit doesn't encourage hard exercise -- while you can do your steps faster by going faster, I found it very hard work to go a little faster, it wasn't really helping get the steps much faster, and took away my enjoyment of my evening walk, listening to audio book or podcasts!

So, while Fitbit was a good start, the time has come to push beyond! Onwards and Upwards!
